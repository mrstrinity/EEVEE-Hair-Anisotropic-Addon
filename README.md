# EEVEE Hair Anisotropy Pak! Addon
Why doesn't Blender have anisotropy for EEVEE by default? That's alright. I got it. 

I finally decided to make [this](https://payhip.com/b/PsFS5) an addon. So now, you don't have to append these two nodes ***every time*** anymore. It'll always be there (As long as the addon is installed, of course.

# Examples of it being used
Yes; these were all rendered in EEVEE.

# How-To's
## Installation
- Go under the "Releases" tab and download the hair_anisotropy_pak.zip.
- **DO NOT EXTRACT THE ZIP.** That is the addon.
- In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Addons and click the Install button.
- Find where you placed the zip. I would highly recommend you put this somewhere in a more organzied spot. Like a "Blender addons" folder.
- Once you click on it, you should see "Node: EEVEE Anisotropy Hair Addon!" click the checkbox. 

**That's it!**

## How to use the nodes
*(If you're seeing this, that means the video is not up yet. Stay tuned; it's coming soon.)*

# Things to note
These are some of my observations. If there are any more things to note or confirm, I will update this.

- You *could* use these in Cycles. *(Though I don't see why you'd use the anisotrophic node there... I dunno. I don't use Cyles for my projects.)*
- I made this with 3.6.15 in mind. I don't know if you can use these with Blender 2.8 going up, but you CAN use this on Blender 4.5.5 LTS.

Any issues and thoughts? Lemme know!
