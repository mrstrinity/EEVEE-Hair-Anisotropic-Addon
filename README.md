# EEVEE Hair Anisotropy Pak! Addon
Why doesn't Blender have anisotropy by default? That's alright. I got it. 

I finally decided to make [this](https://payhip.com/b/PsFS5) an addon. So now, you don't have to append these two nodes ***every time*** anymore. It'll always be there (As long as the addon is installed, of course.)
